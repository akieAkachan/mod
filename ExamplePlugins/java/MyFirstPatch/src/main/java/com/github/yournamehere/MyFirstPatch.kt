Special day, graduation.\nNever thought I'd make it.\nThree days grade school,\nthree days high school.\nThose were awkward.\nThree days college. I'm glad I took\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\nYou did come back different.\n- Hi, Barry.\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\n- Hear about Frankie?\n- Yeah.\n- You going to the funeral?\n- No, I'm not going.\nEverybody knows,\nsting someone, you die.\nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\nI guess he could have\njust gotten out of the way.\nI love this incorporating\nan amusement park into our day.\nThat's why we don't need vacations.\nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\nunder the circumstances.\n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n- We are!\n- Bee-men.\n- Amen!\nHallelujah!\nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\nWelcome, New Hive Oity\ngraduating class of...\n...9:15.\nThat concludes our ceremonies.\nAnd begins your career\nat Honex Industries!\nWill we pick ourjob today?\nI heard it's just orientation.\nHeads up!
